# SlackFun
Playing around with posting various things to slack from C#.

1.) Follow Slack's current instructions to enable apps and obtain authorization.
2.) Plug into any C# program that you want to Post messages from.

I found Slack messages to be particularly useful when used as part of DevOps, Testing and CI, and any type of logging.
