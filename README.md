# SlackFun

Playing around with posting various things to slack from C#.

I found Slack messages to be particularly useful to the team when used to enhance DevOps, CI, testing, and any type of app logging.

1.) Follow Slack's current instructions to authorize 2.) Plug into any C# program that you want to Post messages from.
